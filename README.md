# Hi, I’m Mohammed Hanan 👋

I’m an **Electrical & Electronics Engineering (EEE) student** and the **founder of CosmIQ Software Solutions**, focused on building **affordable, automation-driven software** through deep research and practical application of **AI and LLM-based systems**.

I’m particularly interested in **reasoning under uncertainty**, system-level design, and using AI to make complex solutions **accessible and low-cost**.

---

## Research & Innovation
- Filed a **patent in battery-free biometric systems**, exploring energy-efficient and sustainable authentication mechanisms
- Deep interest in **AI systems, LLM reasoning layers, and automation-first software design**
- Focus on building systems that respect **real-world constraints**, not hype

---

## Current & Upcoming Projects

### 🔹 Crowd-Aware Transit Estimation
A conceptual project exploring how **crowd-derived human signals**, interpreted through LLM-style reasoning, can complement conventional transit tracking systems by adjusting **confidence**, not predicting exact arrival times.

## Cybersecurity (Learning Phase)
- Beginner in cybersecurity, but a **serious self-learner**
- Exploring system vulnerabilities, defensive thinking, and secure design
- Interested in understanding systems from both **build** and **break** perspectives

---

## Languages
Fluent in:
- English
- Hindi
- Malayalam
- Urdu
- Arabic  

Also familiar with basic Spanish.

---

## How I Build
- Start from **first principles**
